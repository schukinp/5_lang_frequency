# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)

# How to start:

The script requires at least Python 3.5

#### To run the code:

* Put your file into root script folder
* Run lang_frequency.py -file `file name.extension` -n `number of words you want to display`


Linux:
```
$ python lang_frequency.py -file poem.txt -n 10
Most common words are (word, times):
('a', 10)
('the', 6)
('i', 6)
('in', 5)
('dream', 5)
('or', 4)
('not', 3)
('that', 3)
('my', 3)
('is', 3)
```
