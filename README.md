# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)

# How to start:

The script requires at least Python 3.5

To run the code:

Run lang_frequency.py  
Enter path to the text file  
Enter the number of the most frequent words to display

Linux:
