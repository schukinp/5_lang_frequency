# Frequency Analysis of Words

Script prints most frequently used words

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)

# How to start:

The script requires at least Python 3.5

To run the code open get_most_frequent_words.py and fill in parameters:
        filepath: path to your file including file extension
        number: number of most frequent words to print

Linux:
```bash
$ python get_most_frequent_words.py # possibly requires call of python3 executive instead of just python
        Most frequent words are:
        Word: 'a' | Frequency: 10
        Word: 'the' | Frequency: 6
        Word: 'I' | Frequency: 6
        Word: 'or' | Frequency: 4
        Word: 'in' | Frequency: 3
        Word: 'not' | Frequency: 3
        Word: 'my' | Frequency: 3
        Word: 'Is' | Frequency: 3
        Word: 'within' | Frequency: 3
        Word: 'from' | Frequency: 2
        ```
Windows starts the same way
